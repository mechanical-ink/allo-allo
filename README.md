Allo Allo is a simple welcome bot for GitHub. It will welcome new users to your repository and help them get started.

## Usage

When a contributor opens their first issue or pull request, Allo Allo will leave a comment to welcome them to your repository. You can choose to only add a comment on new issues or new pull requests by specifying only one of the options.
